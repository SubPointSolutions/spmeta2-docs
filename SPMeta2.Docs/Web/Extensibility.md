SPMeta2 was designed as highly extensible library to a wide range of SharePoint artifacts, SharePoint editions, versinos and APIs. 

We support provisioning of more than hundred artifacts, support SharePoint 2010, 2013 and SharePoint Online along with CSOM/SSOM object models.

Before you begin, make sure you are familiar with the following concepts:

* [SPMeta definitions](http://docs.subpointsolutions.com/spmeta2/definitions/)

SPMeta2 API can be extended to meet specific project needs in the following ways:

* Custom definition 
* Custom syntax
