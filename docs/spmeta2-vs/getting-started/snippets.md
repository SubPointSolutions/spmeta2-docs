That's the last missing bit of the documentation for the templates, can live with that for a while. 

Once SPMeta2 extensions are installed - just type "m2" somewhere in the code and see what you get. All snippets start with "m2XXX" providing shortcuts to define most of the artefacts / definitions.

Enjoy, and we will put a few more words here soon.
