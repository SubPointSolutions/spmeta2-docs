SPMeta2 is a fluent API for code-based SharePoint artefact provisioning.

Struggling with SharePoint’s API inconsistency, bugs, “by-design” behaviour, unaffordable amount of time to write, support and upgrade WSP packages and XML, a team of passionate SharePoint professionals decided to come up with robust, testable and repeatable way to deploy such artefacts as fields, content types, custom actions, webs, libraries and lists, list view, wiki pages, web part pages, security group and roles, and many more – you name it!

As an outcome, we created SPMeta2 – a .NET 4.5 library to provide fluent API for SharePoint artefact provision with SSOM/CSOM or JSOM for both on-premise SP2013 and O365 instances. Keen to see it in action? Have a look around and let us know what you think of it.
